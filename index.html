<h1> <strong>From Cylinders to Audiobooks</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Welcome to my DH201 Final Project: From Cylinders to Audiobooks</strong></p>

<p id="highlight">The history of audiobooks can be traced back to Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph in 1877 and his recitation of Mary Had a Little Lamb on a sheet of tinfoil.</p>
